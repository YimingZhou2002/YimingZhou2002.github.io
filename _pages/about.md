# üßë‚Äçüíº About Me

<!-- Hi,I am Yiming Zhou, a third-year undergraduate student at Yingcai Honors College, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China. Majoring in Computer Science and Technology, I am deeply passionate about computer vision and artificial intelligence. -->
Hi,I'm **Yiming Zhou**, a freshman PhD student at School of Software, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. Majoring in **Software Engineering**, I am deeply passionate about **computer network systems**Ôºå**computer vision and artificial intelligence**.

During my undergraduate studies, I have consistently maintained a perfect GPA of 4.00/4.00, **ranking first** among 137 students. I have also achieved notable successes in various competitions, including National Second Prizes in the fields of electronic design and embedded chip and system design. Additionally, I have been honored with scholarships such as the Xiaomi Scholarship and the Eleventh Technology Progress Scholarship.

I once worked as a Research Intern at the Future Media Research Center, University of Electronic Science and Technology. Under the supervison of Professor Xing Xu, I am exploring topics in computer vision and artificial intelligence, with a focus on industrial anomaly detection and pattern recognition. 

Aside from academics and research, I actively engage in extracurricular activities and student work. I have served in roles such as the Party Sec of second party branch at Yingcai Honors College and have had the opportunity to participate in an exchange program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology during a summer vacation.

**Feel free to reach out to me via email at yiming_zhou2002@163.com, phone at (+86)18633065878, or QQ at 768263769. I am always eager to connect and explore new opportunities for collaboration and growth.**
<!--

# üìö Publications & Projects

## Publications

- **VQ-Flow: Taming Normalizing Flows for Multi-Class Anomaly Detection** *(October 2023 - March 2024)*
  - VQ-Flow constructs a unified framework for multi-class anomaly detection, applying flow models for the first time in this field. It consists of a multi-layer feature extractor, multi-layer flow models, and a series of feature codebooks. By employing quantization and fitting feature codebooks to mixed Gaussian distributions, VQ-Flow enhances the model's ability to reconstruct multi-class features.
  - Achieved superior performance on the MVTec AD dataset and the VisA dataset compared to the current state-of-the-art model (DiAD AAAI2024 by Tencent Lab). 
  - Responsible for building the feature extractor, implementing the model, and conducting related experiments.

## Projects

- **Smart Guidance Helmet** *(March 2023 - August 2023)*
  - National Second Prize, National University Embedded Chip and System Design Competition.
  - Utilized the OpenMV embedded system with MicroPython runtime environment and various peripherals to provide diverse navigation and obstacle avoidance services for the visually impaired.
  - Developed obstacle avoidance and pathfinding functionalities using depth estimation models (MiDaS) and text-to-speech capabilities through OCR text recognition.
  - Responsible for system design, construction, and programming.
- **Distributed Microkernel Operating Systems & Key technologies** *(October 2024 - June 2026)*
  - Nation Science Foundation of China Project, under grant NSFC 62332012.
  - Develop secure and efficient Microkernel System.
- **Inductance-Capacitance Measurement Device** *(June 2023 - August 2023)*
  - National Second Prize, National University Electronic Design Competition.
  - Designed a set of measurement devices for capacitance and inductance based on bridge method and LC series network resonance method.
  - Achieved accurate and wide-ranging measurement of capacitance and inductance.
  - Responsible for system design, circuit construction, and report writing.
- **Infrared Gesture Recognition System Based on Artificial Intelligence** *(September 2022 - September 2023)*
  - Led a university innovation and entrepreneurship project.
  - Constructed an infrared receiver array and processed the collected infrared gesture features using LSTM, VGG, and other neural networks to obtain gesture category information.
  - Successfully completed and approved by the university.
  - Responsible for building the receiver array, deploying driving algorithms, and initial research and construction of neural networks.
